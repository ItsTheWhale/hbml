# Simple macros

The simplest type of macro are replacement macros. These don't consume any elements, and are very simple to define.

We always define macros the same way
```hbml
--macro_name {
    // What the macro expands into
}
```

You can also use the arrow operator if it expands into a single element such as if your macro will expand into a string or table.

## Calling macros

To call a macro, all you need to do is type a colon (`:`) then the name of the macro you want to call. For example, in all HBML files, you'll see the `:root` macro which expands into required HTML attributes.

## Examples

### Page text in macros

One use for simple macros like this is putting the text of a page into macros to make writing the page a bit cleaner. To do this you might have something like the following

```hbml
--main_header > "Place your page header here"
--main_body {
    p > "Some text here"
    img[src="photo.png"]
}
```

### Head tags

Large projects often require using lots of external scripts (FontAwesome, JS libraries, font scripts, etc.). And for most of the files you use, there will be duplicated sections in the `head` section of your page. So, you could define a macro that includes all the repeated `head` sections and then call that in your pages

```hbml
--head-base {
    script[src="script1.js"]
    link[rel='stylesheet' href='style.css']
}
```
