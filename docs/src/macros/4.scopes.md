# Scopes

Scopes are important in discussing macros and understanding how they work can be very useful.

A scope is a section of HBML that has access to the same macros and is either the root scope or under an element.

For example, if we had
```hbml
--macro1 > "Hello"
{
    --macro2 > "World"
}
```

then we have two scopes; the root scope, and the scope inside the brackets. Because the macro `:macro2` is defined in the brackets, it's not usable outside of them because it "doesn't exist".
