# Macro children

Macros can do more than just turn into text. If macros have child elements, you can make use of them in the macro.

When you define a macro, you have access to the `:child` and `:children` macros in that definition. The `:child` macro will get the next child element under the macro call or, if no child elements are left, an empty string. The `:children` macro will get all the remaining elements under the macro, or an empty string of there aren't anymore.

The best way to show this is to see some examples, so that's what we've done

## Examples

### A list macro

This example is a bit pointless considering how simple it is to define a list, but there we are

```hbml
--list {
    ul {
        li > :child
        li > :child
        li > :child
    }
}
```

### Elements in a block

If you need everything on your page to be nested inside several items to make sure it's formatted correctly, you might use a macro for that

```hbml
--block > .class1 > .class2 > .class3 > :children
```

Notice how you don't have to surround `:children` in brackets. Because it looks like one element, we treat `:children` as one element when reading macro definitions. When it gets expanded, all the child elements will be grouped under `.class3` as you would expect.

## An important note

When using `:child`, it may be the case that some child elements remain un-used. If and when this happens, a warning or error is raised about it depending on your build set-up.
