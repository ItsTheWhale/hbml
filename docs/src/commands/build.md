# Build

The `hbml build` command will build files or a project into HTML.

This command can either be run as `hbml build project` to build your project (see [the project section](../get_start/setup.md) for more info on projects); or with some number of files or directories you want to build.

When running in non-project mode, you can specify various flags to alter the build process. These flags are ignored in project mode.
