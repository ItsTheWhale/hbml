# Lint

The `hbml lint` command will lint files or a project.

This command can either be run as `hbml lint project` to build your project (see [the project section](../get_start/setup.md) for more info on projects); or with some number of files or directories you want to build.

When running in non-project mode, you can specify various flags to alter the build process. These flags are ignored in project mode.
